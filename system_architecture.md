# CV-to-Job Matching System Architecture

## Overview

The CV-to-Job Matching System is designed to analyze user CVs against job descriptions and provide a compatibility rating along with detailed feedback. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and advanced matching algorithms to deliver accurate assessments of how well a candidate's profile matches a specific job posting.
