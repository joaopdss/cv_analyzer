# CV-to-Job Matching System - Port Binding Fix

## Fixing the "No open ports detected" Error

If you encountered the error `No open ports detected, continuing to scan...` during deployment on Render, follow these updated instructions to resolve the issue.

## What Caused the Error

The error occurred because Render couldn't detect which port your application was listening on. This has been fixed in the updated deployment files by:

1. Explicitly setting port 10000 in the render.yaml configuration
2. Updating the gunicorn.conf.py file to properly bind to the specified port
3. Modifying wsgi.py to ensure consistent port configuration

## Updated Deployment Files

The following files have been updated:
- `render.yaml` - Now explicitly specifies port 10000
- `gunicorn.conf.py` - Updated to properly handle the PORT environment variable
- `wsgi.py` - Modified to use a consistent port configuration

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Your Repository

If you've already created a GitHub repository:

```bash
# Pull the updated files
git pull

# Or manually update the files and commit
git add render.yaml gunicorn.conf.py wsgi.py
git commit -m "Fix port binding issue"
git push
```

If you haven't created a repository yet, use these updated files from the new deployment package.

### 2. Deploy to Render

If you've already attempted deployment:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Click on "Manual Deploy" and select "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. This will force Render to use the updated configuration

If you haven't deployed yet:

1. Follow the original instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md with these updated files
2. The updated configuration will ensure Render can detect your application's port

### 3. Verify the Deployment

After deployment, check the build logs in the Render dashboard to confirm:
- The application successfully binds to port 10000
- Render detects the open port
- The application starts without errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the Render logs for any error messages
2. Verify that the port is consistently set to 10000 across all configuration files
3. Try setting the environment variable `PORT=10000` in your Render dashboard

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed successfully, use the test_deployed.py script as described in the original documentation to verify that all functionality is working correctly.
